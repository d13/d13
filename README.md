### Hi there, I'm Keith üëã

I'm a developer from a design background and enjoy creating systems that bring cohesion and accessibility for all customers, while providing a developer experience, with documentation and code, that engineering teams love to build with.

I ‚ù§Ô∏è open source!

#### My Work & Shenanigans

- [GitLens for VS Code](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens): the most popular Git extension on the Visual Studio Marketplace
- [Portfolio site](https://keithdaulton.com/): finally updated after being nearly untouched since 2015
